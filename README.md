# Tourist and the impact of exchange rates
Is there a correlation between tourists in Switzerland and direct purchasing power between EUR/CHF and USD/CHF? 
Using data from the Federal Statistical Office (overnight stays) and publicly available exchange rates, I have set myself the goal of first visually processing this question and then statistically 

Eventough a high correlation was suspected, the data showed that there is none.
With a lag of 6 to 12 months, the p value did not improve. (autocorr was used and showed no suitable TS model)

## Key Take outs
- Tidyverse (perparing data)
- intesive GG Plot usage (data visualization)
- correlation with multiple features

## EDA

Tidying with the tidyverse package:

```python
df_ln_inland_yearmon <-
  df_02_ln_ch %>% 
  select(jahre, contains("inland")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("inland"),
               names_to = "key",
               values_to = "anzahl_gaeste_inland") %>% 
  left_join(df_lookup_month_inland) %>% 
  mutate(year_mon = paste0(jahre, "-",month) %>% zoo::as.yearmon() %>% format("%Y-%m")) %>% 
  select(year_mon, anzahl_gaeste_inland)

df_ln_yearmon <- inner_join(df_ln_ausland_yearmon, df_ln_inland_yearmon, by = "year_mon")
  
rm(df_lookup_month_ausland, df_lookup_month_inland, df_ln_inland_yearmon, df_ln_ausland_yearmon)
```
